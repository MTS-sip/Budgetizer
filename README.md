## üöÄ Usage & Testing

#### Using Budgetizer

1. Sign Up or Log In

2. Track Your Budget

Once logged in, you‚Äôll be able to:

- View current totals for key budget categories
- Add subcategories (e.g., Rent under Housing) with custom amounts
- Automatically see updates to category totals and the overall running total

3. Responsive & Interactive

The interface adapts to different screen sizes and includes smooth user interactions such as modals, dropdowns, and animations.

#### Testing the App

While this version of **Budgetizer** does not include a formal testing framework, it has been tested manually to ensure functionality across key use cases:
